# About My Senior Project

> Along with working and coding with others, I was tasked with being the documenter for the project. I kept notes of what we needed to address as well as compile questions for the cleint. I was also tasked with compiling a documentation binder and I can provide a copy of it, if you are interested. This binder goes into more detail of the inter-workings of the project and how we approached our client's problem. Please contact me if interested!
