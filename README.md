## Brief Explanation of Each Project:

    Some of my projects I made at Lindenwood University and at my time at St. Charles Community College. These are not all of the projects I developed, but are the ones I enjoyed and am most proud of. Let me know if you would like to see more of my projects!

### - C++ Projects

<br/>

**GrammarCompilerProject :**
<br/>

> Project developed in my Computer Systems II class. We started with creating a state diagram in the first project. Then in the second project we used this diagram and a set of grammar rules developed by my professor to check an input file. Lastly in project three I took the code from project two and developed a memory manager to develop a way to recognize commands in an input file. Each of these projects built on each other and it was fun to see the project develop.

**TerminalCommandShellProject :**
<br/>

> Computer Systems I project where I developed a terminal command shell. I used fork(), execvp() as well as supporting piping commands. Learned about child and parent processes as well as PID.

**SemaphoreProject :**
<br/>

> Computer Systems I project where we needed to implement professor's code with our own code to protect multiple resources. My professor provided code which utilizes ncurses to animate planes coming onto a runway. Learned how threads and semaphores work to protect resources.

**ClientServerProject :**
<br/>

> Computer Systems II project where I created a server and client code that can interact and send data between each via console commands. It was interesting learning of the new libraries and how network code works.

**DatabaseProjects :**
<br/>

> Two projects I made in my Database class. The first is a file based database. You can interact with the 'database' through console commands. The second project is some C++ code that is used to interact with a mySQL database. You can also interact with the mySQL database through this code after logging into it.

**Divide&ConquerProject :**
<br/>

> Used the Divide and Conquer Algorithm to sort and find the minimum distance between two objects. I coded this project for my Datastructures & Algorithms class. I enjoyed having to use a specific algorithm in order to get the correct answer.

**SortingMethodsProject :**
<br/>

> Had to create a program that could take an input file and sort it depending on user input. Choices are between Heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, and bubble sort. It was interesting seeing how time complexity is very important if you are working with large datasets (which is pretty common). I made this project for my Datastructures and Algorithms class.

### - Java Projects

<br/>

> For each of these projects I developed in my App Development class where we used Android studio. These were my favorite projects I did at St. Charles Community College. I can also provide the full Android studio folder for each if interested.

**CalculatorProject :**
<br/>

> For this project I was tasked with creating a calculator app with other functions like store and recall.

**GameProject :**
<br/>

> This was a game project I developed where you had to click on the changing tiles if they changed color.

**MusicPlayerProject :**
<br/>

> This project I chose to make a music player. It had more than one playlist and made use of a couple android widgets that I was proud of, I also made a custom sprite.

### - Python Projects

<br/>

**IoTFinalProject - Language - Python :**
<br/>

> My final project in my Internet of Things class. I wanted to develop a system to monitor a fish tank.I used ArduinoIDE for the final project where I had 2 arduinos interact with each other. One arduino would read temperature of the water and send it to the other arduino through dweeting the information. After getting the data from the dweet which is stored in a JSON, the second arduino would display the data on the screen on the second arduino and send push alerts via email and through the Blynk app to my phone and email if the water temperature got to high or low. I also had a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor that detects how "hard" or "soft" the water is in the tank. If getting above a certain level it will also send a notification telling you to change the water in the aquarium.

**Senior Project Capstone Course - Language - Python :**
<br/>

> For my Senior Project I worked in a group to create TailTracker. TailTracker is a system for viewing and creating upcoming dog agility competitions. If you would like to take a look, I've included a link below. I worked on the back-end python scripts that control the scheduler for the admin-side of the page. I also worked on the python flask code that runs our server and API routes.

**AIFinalProject - Language - Python :**
<br/>

> This was a group project I made in my Artificial intelligence class at Lindenwood. We had a lot of challenges with the project and ended up not completing all of what we wanted to get done. We modified a machine learning python library: YOLOv5 to pull the names of objects recognized and send them to the Misty Robot. We were tasked with working with the Misty Robots and were the only group in the class that made a project not constrained by the Misty Robot Block coding. We feel like we accomplished a lot given the unfamiliarity with the robot and machine learning as a whole. More detailed description can be found in the project's readme.
