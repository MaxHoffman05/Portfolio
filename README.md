## Brief Explanation of Each Project:

    Some of my projects I made at Lindenwood University. These are not all of the projects I developed, but are the ones I enjoyed and am most proud of.
    Let me know if you would like to see more of my projects!

### - C++ Projects
<br/>

**grammarCompilerProject** 
<br/>
    Project developed in my Computer Systems II class. We started with creating a state diagram in the first project. Then in the second project we used this diagram and a set of grammar rules developed by my professor to check an input file. Lastly in project
    three I took the code from project two and developed a memory manager to develop a way to recognize commands in an input file. Each of these projects built on each other and it was fun to see the project develop.

**terminalCommandShellProject**
<br/>
    Computer Systems I project where I developed a terminal command shell. I used fork(), execvp() as well as supporting piping commands. Learned about child and parent processes as well as PID.

**semaphoreProject**
<br/>
    Computer Systems I project where we needed to implement professor's code with our own code to protect multiple resources. My professor provided code which utilizes ncurses to animate planes coming onto a runway. Learned how threads and semaphores work to protect resources.

**clientServerProject**
<br/>
    Computer Systems II project where I created a server and client code that can interact and send data between each via console commands. It was interesting learning of the new libraries and how network code works.

**databaseProjects**
<br/>
    Two projects I made in my Database class. The first is a file based database. You can interact with the 'database' through console commands. The second project is some C++ code that is used to interact with a mySQL database. You can also interact with the mySQL database through this code after logging into it.

**sortingMethods**
<br/>

**greedyAlgorithms**
<br/>


### - Java Projects
<br/>

### - Python Projects
<br/>

**IoTFinalProject - Language - Python**
<br/>
    My final project in my Internet of Things class. I wanted to develop a system to monitor a fish tank.I used ArduinoIDE for the final project where I had 2 arduinos interact with each other. One arduino would read temperature of the water and send it to the other arduino through dweeting the information. After getting the data from the dweet which is stored in a JSON, the second arduino would display the data on the screen on the second arduino and send push alerts via email and through the Blynk app to my phone and email if the water temperature got to high or low. I also had a KH and GH sensor that detects how "hard" or "soft" the water is in the tank. If getting above a certain level it will also send a notification telling you to change the water in the aquarium.
